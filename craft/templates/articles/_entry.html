 # Article entry template
 # -------------------
 #
 # This template gets loaded whenever an Article entry’s URL is
 # requested. That’s because the Article section’s Template setting is
 # set to “articles/_entry”, the path to this template.
 #
 # When this template is loaded, it will already have an ‘entry’
 # variable, set to the requested Article entry.
 #
 # See this page for more details on how Craft routes requests:
